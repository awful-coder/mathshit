# wtf, math
welcome to the musings of a slightly mad man (or boy, i guess)

i'm here today to fulfill my dreams of writing a math textbook (pretty weird ik)

also the stuff is organized according to when **i** learned them which could be earlier because i went to gifted and pre-ap ¬‿¬ ¬‿¬ ¬‿¬ ¬‿¬ ¬‿¬

so like i dunno, if you dunno either then maybe you will more after you read something here so yeah
