# the quadratic formula
*in this episode i set out on a quest to find out why the quadratic formula is so goofy*

## derivation
so basically the idea is you can [complete the square](../complete) except with arbitrary variables in the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ [except that $a\neq0$ probably because of like dividing or something anyways it doesnt matter because if you have that just use linear equation stuff instead][1]


## cool shit you can do
